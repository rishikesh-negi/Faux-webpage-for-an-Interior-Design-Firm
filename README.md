# Faux-webpage-for-an-Interior-Design-Firm
This is the first webpage I've built using HTML CSS, as a learner. The webpage is intended for an Interior Design firm/studio. Please feel free to correct/refine any quirks/flaws you may find.
I am learning HTML CSS and JS currently. This is a faux webpage for an Interior Design firm. Would appreciate feedback and contributions so that I can learn what I could've done better.
